```

Lint with Flake8:
```bash
flake8 .
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:

- **Code Quality**: Black formatting, Flake8 linting
- **Testing**: Django test suite with coverage reporting
- **Deployment**: Automatic deployment to AWS Elastic Beanstalk on main branch
- **Coverage**: Integration with Coveralls for coverage tracking

### For Contributors

The CI/CD pipeline will automatically run when you:
- Push commits to `main` or `develop` branches
- Open a Pull Request against `main` or `develop` branches

**Requirements for passing CI:**
- All code must pass Black formatting (`black --check .`)
- All code must pass Flake8 linting (`flake8 .`)
- Django system checks must pass (`python manage.py check`)
- All tests must pass (`python manage.py test`)

**Local testing before committing:**
```bash
# Run the full CI pipeline locally
black --check .          # Check formatting
flake8 .                 # Check linting
python manage.py check   # Django system checks
python manage.py test    # Run test suite
```

**AWS Deployment (Optional):**
Deployment to AWS Elastic Beanstalk only occurs on pushes to `main` branch. 
To enable deployment, repository maintainers need to set these secrets in GitHub:
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

All pull requests must pass CI checks before merging.
